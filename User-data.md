Twitter store a really big amount of data about one account. This object helps to explore it.

## Access

Those properties are accessible for both GDPR and classic archives.

- `.id: string`: User ID.
- `.screen_name: string`: User screen name, also called Twitter @.
- `.bio: string`: User profile biography.
- `.created_at: string`: User account creation date, string format. 
You can parse it safely (format may vary) with exported function `parseTwitterDate()` of the module.
- `.name: string`: User name, also called TN.
- `.location: string`: If user has specified a location to its profile, it will be here.

## Basic, GDPR only

Those properties will be filled or defined only if `archive.is_gdpr === true`.

- `.email_address: string`: User current email address.
- `.phone_number: string`: If user have registred a phone number on Twitter, it will be here.
- `.verified: boolean`: True if user is verified on Twitter (the blue check on the profile).
- `.timezone: string`: User timezone. Format may be strange.
